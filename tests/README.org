* sysbench Test Suite

sysbench uses the [[https://bitheap.org/cram/][Cram]] framework for functional and regression
testing. If your system has Python 2.7.9 or later, or Python 3.4 or
later, installing Cram is as simple as executing =pip install cram=. 

If you use an older Python version, you may need to [[https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/][install pip]] first:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
#+END_EXAMPLE

To run the sysbench test suite, invoke the =test_run.sh= script in the
=tests= directory like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
./test_run.sh [test_name]...
#+END_EXAMPLE

Each =test_name= argument is name of a test case file. Functional and
regression tests are located in the same directory in files with the
=.t= suffix.

If no tests are named on the =test_run.sh= command line, it will execute
all files with the =.t= suffix in the current directory.
